# @andrewlkho's dotfiles

This repository contains most of the dotfiles that I use on a regular basis.  It 
is divided up broadly by the UNIX tools they each belong to (zsh, vim _et 
cetera_).  The layout and concept behind this organisation is heavily borrowed 
from [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)'s work.  Hopefully others 
will find parts of this useful, or suggest ways in which my setup could be 
improved.

I'm slowly migrating my dotfiles over from an older repository so with time more 
will appear.


## Installation

Some of the vim configuration uses git submodules, so use `--recursive` to 
clone:

    % git clone --recursive git://github.com/andrewlkho/dotfiles.git

Then to install:

    % ./dotfiles install

This will symlink any file `foo.symlink` as `~/.foo`


## Passwords

Some dotfiles inevitably contain sensitive data.  The way I handle this is to 
create a template file called `foo.example` and replace any sensitive data with 
`__SOME TOKEN__`.  Then, when you run `./dotfiles install` it will ask you what 
to replace that token with (and generate a file called `foo`).

Don't forget that you may want to name files `bar.symlink.example` if they both 
contain sensitive data and need to be symlinked.
